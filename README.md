Week 8 Database Assignment
Database Management System (E-Commerce Store)

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements a relational database management system (RDBMS) for an E-Commerce Store using MySQL. The system is designed to handle customers, orders, products, categories, and payments. It follows proper database design principles, normalization, and relationship constraints.



ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Apply good database design practices.

Implement relationships (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many).

Use constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL).

Provide a scalable structure for real-world e-commerce operations.



ðŸ—‚ Database Schema

1. Customers Table

Stores customer details.

Primary Key: customer_id

Constraints: email is UNIQUE.


2. Customer Profiles Table

One-to-One relationship with customers.

Primary Key & Foreign Key: customer_id

Ensures each customer has at most one profile.


3. Orders Table

One-to-Many relationship with customers.

Each order belongs to a customer.

Foreign Key: customer_id


4. Products Table

Stores product information.

Primary Key: product_id

Includes price, stock, and vendor.


5. Categories Table

Defines product categories.

Primary Key: category_id


6. Product Categories (Junction Table)

Implements a Many-to-Many relationship between products and categories.

Composite Primary Key: (product_id, category_id)

Both are Foreign Keys.


7. Order Items Table

One-to-Many relationship with orders and products.

Composite Primary Key: (order_id, product_id)

Stores product quantities and price per order.


8. Payments Table

One-to-One relationship with orders.

Primary Key & Foreign Key: order_id

Stores payment details.



ðŸ”— Relationships Summary

One-to-One:

Customers â†” Customer Profiles

Orders â†” Payments


One-to-Many:

Customers â†” Orders

Orders â†” Order Items

Products â†” Order Items


Many-to-Many:

Products â†” Categories (via product_categories)



âœ… Constraints Used

PRIMARY KEY â†’ Ensures entity uniqueness.

FOREIGN KEY â†’ Maintains referential integrity.

NOT NULL â†’ Prevents missing required data.

UNIQUE â†’ Prevents duplicate values (e.g., customer email).



ðŸ›  Example Workflow

1. A customer registers â†’ entry in customers and optional customer_profiles.


2. Customer places an order â†’ stored in orders.


3. Products added to the order â†’ stored in order_items.


4. Order payment is processed â†’ stored in payments.




ðŸ“‚ Deliverables

answers.sql â†’ Contains all CREATE DATABASE and CREATE TABLE statements with constraints.

README (this file) â†’ Explains schema design, relationships, and constraints.




ðŸš€ Conclusion

This relational database system demonstrates:

Correct normalization and elimination of redundancy.

Use of all major relationship types.

Strong foundation for extending into a fully functional e-commerce application.
